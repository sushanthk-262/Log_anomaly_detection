#Preprocessing
I have helped Sushanth in Preprocessing. I have preprocessed thunderbird datatset. 
The dataset was already parsed so we did grouping for thunderbird and spirit datasets , used fixed-window grouping.
Created labelled sequence which has anomalous and normal events.
Which later sent to Mahendar for tarining and testing.
#Training
I have also helped mahendar in tarining.
I have trained Thunderbird dataset, repeated same traning method which is done by mahendar for the other datasets.
#Bert base model
Also built Bert base model along with Mahendar in the beginning which used Tenserflow which was not compatible with the Bert model. 
Later this error was rectified by mahendar he built another BertforSequenceClassification which later was used for tarining and testing.
