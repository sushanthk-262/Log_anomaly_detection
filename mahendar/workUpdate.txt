=>Training
	->Trained BertForSequenceClassifiaction Model for 4 Datasets {HDFS,BGL,ThunderBird,Spirit}
=>Testing
	->Tested all models with test data
=>Evaluation
	->Evaluation metrics confusion matrix,accuracy,precision,recall,f1_score are calculated for all models

Process:
=> Feature Extraction and train-test-split of dataset
=>BERT model
	a.Get the encodings from BertTokenizer
	b.Convert the encodings into Dataset Objects
	c.Import the Pretrained BERT base model along with appropriate Trainer and Training args
	d.Train the Bert base model using dataset Objects and Trainer.
	e.Evaluate the model
=> The training and prediction is also done under the utilization of GPU
