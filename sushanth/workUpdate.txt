Tried working with BGL datset, but failed at parsing it in a proper way..
hence moved onto HDFS dataset, also, this dataset was used in the "How far are we?" pdf as an example aswell, hence this dataset is chosen.

Data parsing done on HDFS dataset, stored in list of lists, although this data needs to be cleaned up real soon!

The python script for te same has been pushed to the repo aswell!
